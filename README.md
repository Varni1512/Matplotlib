# Matplotlib Learning Project

## Overview
This repository documents my journey learning **Matplotlib**, a Python library for data visualization. I picked up the basics to prepare for my Machine Learning (ML) adventure, where visualizing data and model results is key. This project includes simple examples of plots Iâ€™ve mastered.

## What I Learned
- Creating basic plots: **line plots**, **scatter plots**, **bar plots**, and **histograms**
- Customizing plots with titles, labels, colors, and grids
- Plotting data from Pandas DataFrames
- Bonus: Adding legends and exploring 3D scatter plots
